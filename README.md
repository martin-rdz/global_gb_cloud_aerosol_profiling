# Global stations with ground-based cloud and aerosol profiling

Overview of stations where ground-based profiling of clouds and aerosols with at least a cloud radar (Ka or W Band) and a collocated lidar is performed.
A similar overview was for example given by Bühl [2017]. In this version a plot with the months of observations summed over a gridbox is provided.
The underlying data is mostly from the [cloudnet](http://cloudnet.fmi.fi/) and [ARM](https://www.arm.gov/) websites.

In case of any additions, errors or comments i would appreciate your feedback.
